"""SQLite connection, schema, and JSON->SQL migration (design D1-D4).

Structural replacement for tools/_storage.py, which is deleted in full in
this same change. Where _storage.py serialized a whole-file read-modify-write
via a filesystem lock, this module serializes at the database with an
explicit ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction and lets SQLite's own file locking
(plus ``busy_timeout``) do the waiting — across processes, not just threads.

Connection-per-call, never cached at module level: sqlite3 connections are
thread-bound (``check_same_thread=True``), and FastMCP dispatches sync tools
on a worker pool, so a cached connection would raise the first time a second
worker thread touched it. This also preserves the ``_X_PATH`` monkeypatch
convention (here ``_DB_PATH``) the whole test suite depends on: it must be
resolved at call time, never bound as a default argument.

The four PRAGMAs re-issued on every connection are the whole point of this
module — none of them persist except journal_mode, and each is a silent,
one-line way to ship the appearance of a guarantee with none of its
enforcement:

- ``foreign_keys = ON``: OFF by default in SQLite. Without it, every
  ``REFERENCES`` clause in the schema below is decorative.
- ``recursive_triggers = ON``: without it, ``INSERT OR REPLACE`` bypasses a
  ``BEFORE DELETE`` trigger, defeating the append-only guarantee on
  ``resume_versions``.
- ``busy_timeout = 10000``: the direct replacement for _storage.py's
  ``_LOCK_TIMEOUT = 10.0``. Same number on purpose.
- ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` (never ``DEFERRED``): a deferred transaction that reads
  first and writes later must *upgrade* to a write lock, and busy_timeout
  does not retry a lock upgrade — it would resurface the exact contention
  failure this design replaces, as a spurious "database is locked".

Migration runs once, inside ``_ensure_schema``, keyed on schema presence
(not file presence) so a partial failure is retryable rather than requiring
manual cleanup. Backups of both legacy JSON files are written before either
is read, and a backup failure aborts the migration rather than proceeding
best-effort — this is irreplaceable, hand-authored data, unlike the
in-memory coercion _backup_once historically guarded.

    Keyed on schema presence, not file presence (D4): the next call after a
    rolled-back partial failure sees "no jobs table" and retries cleanly
    rather than needing manual cleanup.

    The presence check below is deliberately performed TWICE: once outside
    any lock (cheap, the common case after the first run), and again right
    after acquiring the write lock. Two threads or two processes racing on a
    genuinely first run can both see "no jobs table" on the first
    (unlocked) check before either has started its transaction. Without the
    second check, the loser would blindly re-run ``CREATE TABLE`` after the
    winner already committed it and crash on "table jobs already exists" —
    which, being a raw sqlite3.Error, would escape the "this tool NEVER
    raises" boundary. Re-checking under ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` costs nothing
    (same connection already holds the lock) and turns the race into the
    loser simply recognizing the winner already did the work.
