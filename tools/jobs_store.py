"""Job store persistence tools: save_job_analysis, list_jobs, set_application_status.

The conversation-side Claude analyzes a job posting and produces a score and
recommendation. These tools PERSIST and RETRIEVE that structured data — they
never call back to the model. This keeps the server free of MCP sampling and
matches the project's philosophy: tools shape data, Claude reasons.

SQLite-backed (design D1/D3/D8/D9/D10). `jobs.id` is a server-generated
surrogate key — `url` is a nullable, unique ATTRIBUTE, not the identity, so
supplying a URL later never orphans a resume version pointed at the job
(D1's deciding argument). SQL owns structural invariants (url uniqueness via
UNIQUE, referential integrity is resume_versions' concern); pydantic and this
module own value-domain invariants (the 7-value status enum, "at least one
handle" on create) — see design D8, no invariant is expressed in both places.

get_job and list_jobs's `company` filter are PR3a's, not this module's.

    REQUIRED read path for jd_text — without this tool, jd_text is
    write-only).

    `custom_title` exists as a lookup key because it exists as a SAVE
    affordance: a job saved without a `url` is findable ONLY by the
    `custom_title` the user agreed to (analyze.py's `_NO_URL_NOTICE`
    promises exactly this). Without this parameter, that promise had no
    retrieval path at all — a caller could only dump every job via
    `list_jobs` and eyeball it.

    `custom_title` is NOT unique (`save_job_analysis` deliberately never
    matches an existing record by it — R3/SC-08), so a lookup CAN match more
    than one job. Silently returning the first match would hide that
    ambiguity from the caller and could resolve to the wrong job. Instead:
    0 matches -> `not_found`; exactly 1 -> that job; more than 1 ->
    `error="ambiguous"`, naming every matching id so the caller can retry
    with a specific `id`.

    `has_description` is ALWAYS present in the response, regardless of
    `include_description` — it is the affordance that makes the jd_text
    opt-in discoverable without dragging JD text into context by default.
    Also returns the linked resume version SUMMARIES (no content) — the

                               unique — see above for the multi-match rule.
        include_description:  When True and a description was captured,
                               populates `description` with the full pasted
