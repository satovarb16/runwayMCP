"""Resume version store: save_resume_version, get_resume_version, list_resume_versions.

The conversation-side Claude drafts and tailors resume text. This module
PERSISTS and RETRIEVES that raw text — it never parses, structures, scores,
or judges resume content, and it never calls back to the model. This is the
project's third persistence shape: unlike jobs_store.py's upsert-by-key,
resume versions must COEXIST, so this store is append-only with parent_id
lineage.

SQLite-backed (design D1/D2/D3/D6/D8). Append-only is now enforced by the
database, not merely by application discipline: `resume_versions` has
BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers (see tools/_db.py's schema, and test_db.py's
direct-SQL proof that INSERT OR REPLACE is also blocked via
recursive_triggers=ON). `job_id` is a real FOREIGN KEY against jobs.id,
replacing the prior job_url string convention that nothing server-side ever
validated — an unknown job_id is rejected with error="job_not_found", never
a raw sqlite3.IntegrityError and never a generic "invalid_input" (design D8:
SQL owns the referential-integrity invariant, the tool boundary translates
its failure into an actionable message).

`legacy_job_url` is a migration-only column (see tools/_db.py's
_migrate_legacy_stores): never written by save_resume_version, it holds a
pre-0.3.0 job_url string that matched no job at migration time, so that
orphan is excluded from the general-resume selection (SC-46) rather than
being silently promoted to "general" by falling through to job_id=NULL.

    saved job at migration time) from being silently promoted to the
    scoring baseline for every future job (SC-46). Among general candidates,
    the most recently created one wins: a user who refreshes their general
    resume saves it as a new version, and returning the root instead would
    silently ignore every update.

    against some job: return the most recently created root, excluding one
    tailored for `job_id` specifically (never hand back a resume already
    written for the very job being analyzed — that would score it against
    itself). The fallback ALSO requires legacy_job_url IS NULL: a lone
    migration orphan (job_id IS NULL, legacy_job_url set) is a root too, and
    without this clause it would be the fallback's answer — silently
    becoming the general/scoring-baseline resume the migration's own stderr
