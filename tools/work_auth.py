"""Work authorization: set_work_authorization + the live country-comparison
warning wired into analyze_job (design D7, spec R12-R14, tasks 3b.1a-n).

This is NOT a property of the job — it is a COMPARISON between the job's
country and the countries the user has declared they may legally work in. A
job-intrinsic "this role needs a visa" flag has no idea who is asking (the
prior cycle's `visa_verdict`, dropped entirely). The comparison is computed
LIVE on every `analyze_job` call and NEVER persisted: a stored verdict goes
stale the moment the user's authorization changes (they get a visa, one
expires, they move), and a job saved months ago would keep claiming a
country match that no longer holds.

Storage keyed on canonical country (tools/_country.py's pure string
transform — no I/O, ported logic, deliberately not folded into this module
or into tools/_db.py, per #334 D1's "a shared module must not become a
grab-bag" rule). Both the raw and canonical forms are stored, and the raw
form is what gets echoed back and shown in a mismatch warning — a wrong
canonicalization is invisible to the user, a wrong echoed country name is
obvious (D7).

Never-set vs. declared-with-zero-countries (SC-27) are distinct, persisted
states. The `work_authorizations` table alone cannot express this by row
count (both states have zero "real" rows) — see `_MARKER_CANONICAL`.

    REPLACES the previous declaration in its entirety (SC-26) — this is a
    statement about the whole set ("I can work in X and Y"), not an
    additive append. An empty list is a valid, distinct declaration
    (SC-27): "declared, zero countries" differs from "never declared" —
    `analyze_job` treats the two differently (no_work_authorization only
    for the latter).

    Countries are canonicalized at write time (tools/_country.py); both the
    raw text and the canonical form are stored. Two raw spellings that
    canonicalize to the same country (e.g. "USA" and "United States" in one
    call) collapse to a single declared row — the first raw spelling
    encountered wins the echo.

    and are dropped. If that leaves nothing, the call is REJECTED rather than
    silently storing a declaration that means nothing — see the loop below.
