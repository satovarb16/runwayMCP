"""Orchestrator tool: analyze_job.

FINAL 0.3.0 contract (sqlite-memory-and-pasted-jd, design D5). Claude reads
the job description pasted into the conversation, extracts `title`,
`company`, `country` (plus optional `url`/`custom_title`), and passes those
— the raw JD text is NEVER a parameter of this tool. The text is already in
Claude's context; accepting it here would make it travel a second time as
call payload, for text the server cannot use (every parser that provided a
floor of truth is deleted). The text reaches the server exactly once, at
save_job_analysis, and only for jobs the user decides to keep.

Two consequences accepted at the design-decision level (obs #368): there is
NO server-side validation of Claude's extraction — a wrong company or
country is not detected here; and a job analyzed but never saved leaves no
trace of its text. The envelope's `extracted` echo is the only mitigation:
it does not detect a bad extraction, it makes one VISIBLE to the only party
who can catch it.

`analyze_job` is `def`, not `async def`: it has zero awaits, and its only
I/O (SQLite reads) is blocking — an async tool runs on FastMCP's event loop
and would block it on every store read; sync tools run on the worker pool,
where every other store tool already runs.

Guard 1 (anti-self-scoring, SC-21) resolution, carried forward from PR2's
tasks 2.5l/2.5n and now adapted to `url` being OPTIONAL (task 3a.2j): when
`url` is given, it is resolved to a `job_id` via an exact lookup against the
`jobs` table before calling the job_id-keyed `_general_resume`. When `url`
is absent but `custom_title` is given, the SAME resolution happens against
`custom_title` instead — a job saved without a `url` (the referral case
`_NO_URL_NOTICE` exists for) is still resolvable, so the guard stays armed
on that path too; a naive "no url -> job_id=None always" reading of an
earlier revision of this docstring was WRONG for exactly this case: it
would silently hand back a job's own tailored resume when that job is
re-analyzed by custom_title alone, the precise self-scoring inflation this
guard exists to prevent. `job_id` is None only when neither `url` nor
`custom_title` is given, or the one given matches no saved job — never a
blanket bypass. `custom_title` is NOT unique (see jobs_store.py's
`_find_job_ids_by_custom_title`); when it resolves to more than one job,
this tool refuses to guess and returns `error="ambiguous_custom_title"`
rather than silently picking one (which could arm the guard for the wrong
job, or fail to arm it for the right one).

Guard 2 (no_resume vs corrupt) is preserved by wrapping the url/custom_title
-> job_id resolution and the _general_resume call in a single try/except
ValueError block: a corrupt or unreadable database raises from any of those
calls and is reported as "corrupt"; "no_resume" is reported only when the
database is readable but nothing usable was found.

Work authorization (design D7, task 3b.1m) is Step 2, inserted between the
resume precondition (Step 1, unchanged) and envelope-build (now Step 3):
`_declared_authorizations()` returns None only when set_work_authorization
has NEVER been called (never a default — defaulting to any country, e.g.
the US, would mis-warn everyone outside it), producing
error="no_work_authorization". A database corrupt enough to break THIS
read is reported as "corrupt", never "no_work_authorization" — the same
Guard-2-style distinction Step 1 already makes for the resume precondition,
extended to this one. The comparison itself
(`tools.work_auth._check_work_authorization`) is LIVE: computed fresh on
every call against the CURRENT declared set, never persisted — a stored
verdict would go stale the moment the user's authorization changes, exactly
the mistake the deleted `visa_verdict` made.

Precondition ordering, decided deliberately (not incidentally): resume
FIRST, work-authorization SECOND. A first-time user with neither saved
loses only the resume message on this call and gets the work-authorization
message on the very next one — one extra round trip, not "many". Reversing
the order was rejected because `test_sc38_empty_store_no_resume_error`
(PR3a, pinned) already asserts "no_resume" wins when both preconditions are
unset — an already-shipped guard this chain's "never weaken a safety test"
rule forbids relitigating by changing behavior out from under it.

Adds zero new external dependencies — the resume lookup is delegated to
tools/resumes.py and tools/jobs_store.py; the work-authorization lookup and
comparison to tools/work_auth.py.

    The resume injected here is the GENERAL resume (design D6), not the most
    recently tailored one: scoring a job against a resume already tailored
    FOR that job would inflate the match score by scoring the resume against
    itself.

    This tool NEVER raises for any documented failure mode — all such
    failures are encoded in the return envelope. An unexpected keyword
    argument (e.g. a JD text payload) is a caller programming error and

                      (exact match against the jobs table) so the
                      general-resume selection can exclude a resume already

        custom_title: The user's handle for a URL-less job. Echoed back, AND
                      — when `url` is absent — resolved to a job_id the same
                      way `url` is, so Guard 1 (anti-self-scoring) stays
