"""Pure country-name canonicalization (design D7).

No I/O, no pydantic — deliberately not folded into tools/_db.py (#334 D1's
"a shared module must not become a grab-bag" rule). Ported logic from the
deleted tools/jobs.py::_normalize_country, with a different canonical
spelling chosen at design time ("UNITED STATES"/"UNITED KINGDOM" rather than
the old "USA"/"UK") so the canonical form is unambiguous prose, matching
what a work-authorization mismatch warning shows the user verbatim.

Free text in, canonicalized at write, both forms stored — see
tools/work_auth.py (PR3b). This module only does the string transform.
