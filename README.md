runwayMCP is a memory for your job hunt. You paste a job description into the conversation;
Claude scores it, tailors a resume, and runwayMCP remembers which jobs you applied to, what
state each one is in, and — the part that matters most — **which resume version you sent for
each job**. Ask "did I apply to Datadog?" months later and get back "yes, and here's the exact
resume you sent."

## Quick install

### Option A: Claude Code plugin (recommended — two commands)

```
/plugin marketplace add satovarb16/runwayMCP
/plugin install runway-mcp@satovarb
```

Claude Code wires up the MCP server for you — no JSON to edit.

**Updating:** new releases arrive through the normal plugin flow — no need to touch PyPI.

```
/plugin marketplace update satovarb
/plugin update runway-mcp@satovarb
```

Then run `/reload-plugins` (or restart Claude Code) to load the new version. The plugin
pins an exact package version, so updating it pulls the matching server release.

### Option B: manual `.mcp.json`

Create a `.mcp.json` file in the directory where you run Claude Code:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "runway-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["runway-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Open Claude Code — `uvx` downloads and runs the server automatically.

> **Don't have `uv`?** Install it: `pip install uv` (or see [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

### Alternative: install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satovarb16/runwayMCP
cd runwayMCP
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then use `python -m server` instead of `uvx runway-mcp` in your `.mcp.json`, and add `"cwd": "/path/to/runwayMCP"`.

## Why runwayMCP doesn't fetch job postings, and never checked visa sponsorship this way

Earlier versions of this server fetched job postings from Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever
(`fetch_job_posting`) and checked H-1B sponsorship history against USCIS data
(`check_visa_sponsorship`). Both tools, along with the read-only `get_profile` migration
hatch, are **removed as of this release** — not deprecated, deleted.

The fetch/scrape approach was fragile by construction: every job board changes its markup on
its own schedule (and increasingly blocks headless scraping outright), so a server that parses
HTML is permanently one layout change — or one anti-bot update — away from silently returning
garbage. Claude, on the other hand, already reads the job posting you paste into the
conversation. It does not need the server to fetch a second copy of the same text over HTTP.
The server's job is to **persist and shape data**, not to scrape it.

The USCIS H-1B sponsorship lookup went with it. It's replaced by something smaller and more
honest: `set_work_authorization` lets you declare, once, the countries you may legally work in,
and `analyze_job` compares each job's country against that declaration live, on every call —
never a stored, staleness-prone verdict. See [Work authorization](#step-0b-required-declare-your-work-authorization)
below.
<!-- historical:end -->

## Step 0 (required): save your resume

**Do this once before anything else.** `analyze_job` needs a stored resume — without one
it returns a `no_resume` error asking you to save one first.

```
You: "Here's my CV, save it as my general resume: /path/to/resume.pdf"
```

Claude reads your CV, drafts the resume as plain text, and saves it with
`save_resume_version` (see [Tools](#tools) below for the full reference).
Resume versions are **raw text, versioned, and append-only** — nothing is ever
overwritten or deleted. The first version you save (`parent_id=None`) establishes the
base of the tree. Later, when you decide to apply somewhere, Claude saves a version
*tailored* for that job pointing back at an existing one (`parent_id=<some version's
id>`, `job_id=<the id save_job_analysis returned for that job>`) without touching it —
`analyze_job` never scores a job against a resume already rewritten for that same job,
since that would just be scoring the resume against itself.

**Your "general" resume is the most recent version with no `job_id`** — not
necessarily the first one. Those are the same thing until you update your CV, and
different afterwards.

Updated your CV? Save it as a new version with `parent_id` set to any existing version's
id and **no `job_id`**. It becomes your general resume by being the most recent
untailored one. Passing `parent_id=None` a second time is rejected — there is only ever
one root.

## Step 0b (required): declare your work authorization

`analyze_job` also needs to know where you're allowed to work — without it, it returns a
`no_work_authorization` error asking you to declare this first.

```
You: "I can legally work in the United States and Germany."
Claude: set_work_authorization(countries=["United States", "Germany"])
```

This **replaces** any prior declaration — it's a statement about the whole set, not an
addition. From then on, every `analyze_job` call compares that job's country against your
current declaration **live** (never cached, never stored on the job record) and returns one
of three outcomes in `work_authorization.status`:

- `"authorized"` — the job's country matches a declared one. No warning.
- `"warned"` — it doesn't match. `work_authorization.warning` names both the job's country
  and your declared list, exactly as you and the job posting stated them, so a false warning
  caused by an unrecognized spelling is self-diagnosing.
- `"undetermined"` — the job's country couldn't be read at all (empty, or something like
  `"..."`). Never silently treated as authorized or as a mismatch.

The warning is advisory only — it never blocks `analyze_job` from returning a result.

## Usage: paste a job, don't link one

runwayMCP never fetches a job posting. Paste the description into the conversation, and
Claude extracts what it needs:

```
You: "Evaluate this for me — [paste the full job description]"
Claude:
  1. Extracts title, company, and country from the pasted text
  2. analyze_job(title=..., company=..., country=..., url=<link, if you have one>)
     → your general resume + a scoring guide + a work-authorization check
  3. Scores the match against the posting text already in this conversation
     → APPLY / CONSIDER / SKIP + reasoning
  4. If APPLY or CONSIDER: tailors your resume and saves it
     → save_job_analysis(..., jd_text=<the full posting>) returns an id
     → save_resume_version(..., job_id=<that id>)
```

**`url` is optional.** If the posting has no URL (a referral, a screenshot, a DM), give it a
`custom_title` instead — a short, memorable label like `"Acme referral role"`. **You need to
remember that title**, because unlike a URL it isn't unique: two jobs can share the same
`custom_title`, and a later lookup by title alone can be ambiguous (`get_job` or `analyze_job`
will refuse to guess and ask you to specify an `id` instead). Claude will remind you of this
the first time you save a job with no URL.

The job's full pasted text (`jd_text`) is stored only if you pass it to `save_job_analysis` —
`analyze_job` itself never sees or stores it, and a job you analyze but never save leaves no
trace.

## Tracking applications

```
You: "I applied to that Datadog role."
Claude: set_application_status(id=<job id>, status="applied")

You: "Did I apply to Datadog?"
Claude: list_jobs(company="Datadog")
        → get_job(id=<the match>) → linked resume version summaries
        → get_resume_version(id=<that version>) → the exact text you sent
```

Application status is one of 7 values: `not_applied`, `applied`, `interviewing`, `offer`,
`rejected`, `withdrawn`, `ghosted`. Transitions are deliberately unvalidated — any status can
move to any other (a reopened process is real), and `list_jobs(status=...)` takes either a
single value or a list, so "what's currently in progress" (`applied`, `interviewing`, `offer`)
is one call, not three.

## Storage and migration

All data lives in one local SQLite database at `~/.config/runway-mcp/runway.db`. If you're
upgrading from a pre-0.3.0 install with `jobs.json`/`resumes.json`, the **first** tool call
after upgrading migrates both files into the database automatically — a `.bak` copy of each
original is written first, and the JSON files themselves are left untouched. Nothing to run,
nothing to configure.

If you have an even older, pre-0.2.0 `~/.config/runway-mcp/profile.json` (a structured profile
from before resume versioning existed), it is **not** migrated automatically — the tool that
used to read it back out, and the whole structured-profile system it belonged to, are gone in
this release with no replacement. Read the file yourself (or ask Claude to), and save its
content as your general resume:

```
You: "Here's my old profile.json content — save it as my general resume text."
Claude: save_resume_version(content=<rewritten as resume text>, label="General", parent_id=None)
```

The server never reads, writes, or deletes `profile.json` — delete it yourself once you've
migrated by hand.

## How it works

Claude Code launches this server over stdio and calls its tools when relevant. You don't
invoke the tools directly — Claude decides when to call them based on the conversation.

The tools **persist and shape data**; Claude does the reasoning. The server never calls
back to the model (no MCP sampling), so it works on any MCP host — including Claude Code,
which does not support sampling. Claude drafts and tailors your resume text itself, scores
the job-vs-resume match using the rubric `analyze_job` returns, and decides what to save;
the server only persists what Claude gives it.

## Status

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| `analyze_job` | Working — loads your general resume, a scoring guide, and a live work-authorization check |
| `save_job_analysis` | Working — persists an analyzed job (upserts by id, then by url) |
| `get_job` | Working — retrieves one job by id/url/custom_title, with linked resume version summaries |
| `list_jobs` | Working — lists stored jobs, filterable by company, status, score, date |
| `set_application_status` | Working — sets a stored job's application status |
| `save_resume_version` | Working — saves a resume version (raw text, append-only) |
| `get_resume_version` | Working — retrieves a resume version by id or `"latest"` |
| `list_resume_versions` | Working — lists saved resume versions, newest first |
| `set_work_authorization` | Working — declares the countries you may legally work in |

## Tools

### `analyze_job(title: str, company: str, country: str, url: str | None = None, custom_title: str | None = None) -> AnalyzeJobResult`

Read-only — writes nothing. Loads your **general resume** and a scoring guide so Claude can
score the match against the job posting text already in this conversation (the server never
fetches it). Also runs a live work-authorization comparison for `country` against your current
declaration.

Preconditions, checked in order:
- `error="no_resume"` — no usable general resume exists yet. Run `save_resume_version` first.
- `error="no_work_authorization"` — you haven't called `set_work_authorization` yet.
- `error="corrupt"` — the store exists but couldn't be read. Distinct from the two above:
  telling you to run the tool that writes to the same broken file wouldn't help.
- `error="ambiguous_custom_title"` — more than one saved job shares the `custom_title` you
  passed; re-analyze with `url` instead, or use `get_job` with a specific `id` first.

On success, returns:

```json
{
  "extracted": { "title": "...", "company": "...", "country": "...", "url": null, "custom_title": "Acme referral role" },
  "resume": { "id": "...", "label": "...", "content": "...", "parent_id": null, "job_id": null, "created_at": "..." },
  "scoring_guide": { "instructions": "...", "recommendation_rules": ["SKIP if the match score is below 40.", "..."] },
  "work_authorization": { "status": "warned", "warning": "This job's country ('Germany') is not among your declared work-authorized countries (United States)." },
  "notice": null
}
```

**Recommendation rules** (Claude applies these from `scoring_guide`):
- `SKIP` if the match score is below 40.
- `APPLY` if the match score is 70 or higher.
- `CONSIDER` in every other case.

The general resume is selected so it was never written for the job being analyzed: the most
recently saved version with no `job_id`, or — if every version is tailored to some job — the
most recent root version, excluding any tailored to the job you're analyzing now.

### `save_job_analysis(title: str, company: str, country: str, id: str | None = None, url: str | None = None, custom_title: str | None = None, jd_text: str | None = None, score: int | None = None, recommendation: str | None = None, notes: str | None = None) -> SaveJobResult`

Persists an analyzed job record. At least one of `url` or `custom_title` is required — that's
how you (or Claude) find the record again later. Resolution order: `id` given → updates that
exact record (`error="not_found"` if unknown); no `id` but `url` matches an existing record →
upsert by URL, unchanged semantics from prior releases (an omitted optional argument leaves
the existing value in place, so a bare re-save never wipes your score/notes); otherwise → a
new record. **Never matches by title** — editing a title for clarity never silently creates or
merges a duplicate.

Setting a `url` that another job already has returns `error="duplicate_url"`; neither record
changes. Saving without a `url` returns a `message` reminding you the `custom_title` is now the
only handle to this record — worth surfacing to the user, since they'll need to recall it.

### `get_job(id: str | None = None, url: str | None = None, custom_title: str | None = None, include_description: bool = False) -> GetJobResult`

Retrieves one job by exactly one of `id`, `url`, or `custom_title`. `has_description` is always
present so you can tell a description exists without paying to load it; pass
`include_description=True` to get the full pasted text back in `description`. Also returns the
linked resume version **summaries** (no content) — this is the headline query: "did I apply to
X?" → "yes, and here's the resume." Fetch the actual text with `get_resume_version`.

Because `custom_title` isn't unique, matching more than one job returns `error="ambiguous"`
naming every matching id, rather than silently picking one. Unknown id/url/custom_title →
`error="not_found"`.

### `list_jobs(since: str | None = None, status: str | list[str] | None = None, min_score: int | None = None, company: str | None = None, limit: int | None = None, sort_by: str = "analyzed_at") -> ListJobsResult`

Lists stored jobs, filtered → sorted → limited. `company` is a case-insensitive substring
match — this is the headline query, "did I apply to Acme?" `status` takes **one status or a
list of statuses**, so "what have I applied to" (`applied`, `interviewing`, `offer`, and
whatever else you consider active) is a single call. `sort_by` is `"analyzed_at"` (default,
newest first) or `"score"` (descending, unscored jobs last). Job records never include the full
pasted description (`jd_text`) — only `get_job(include_description=True)` returns it.

### `set_application_status(status: str, id: str | None = None, url: str | None = None, notes: str | None = None) -> SetStatusResult`

Sets a stored job's application status to one of the 7 values: `not_applied`, `applied`,
`interviewing`, `offer`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`, `ghosted`. **Transitions are deliberately
unvalidated** — any status can move to any other (e.g. `rejected` → `interviewing` succeeds),
because reopened hiring processes are real and the server doesn't get to say otherwise. Prefer
`id` over `url` — it always resolves, even for jobs saved without a URL. Returns
`error="not_found"` for an unknown id/url, `error="invalid_status"` for an unrecognized value
(record left unchanged).

### `save_resume_version(content: str, label: str, parent_id: str | None = None, job_id: str | None = None) -> SaveResumeVersionResult`

Saves a new resume version as raw text. **Append-only** — no version is ever mutated or
deleted (enforced by the database, not just application discipline), so your history is always
intact. The store enforces a single-root tree:
- The **first** version you ever save must have `parent_id=None` — this establishes your
  general resume.
- Every version after that **must** set `parent_id` to an existing version's id. Passing
  `parent_id=None` again (or an unknown id) is rejected.
- `job_id` is optional — set it when a version is tailored for a specific job. It must
  reference a job that already exists: **call `save_job_analysis` first** and pass the `id` it
  returns. An unknown `job_id` returns `error="job_not_found"`, not a raw database error.

Returns `error="invalid_parent"` (empty store expects `parent_id=None`, non-empty store
requires it) or `error="parent_not_found"` (unknown `parent_id`) on failure — no version is
written in either case.

### `get_resume_version(id: str) -> GetResumeVersionResult`

Retrieves one resume version by its exact `id`, or the most recently *created* version via
`id="latest"` (not necessarily the general one — if the newest version is tailored to some
job, `"latest"` returns that). Returns `error="not_found"` if no such version exists.

### `list_resume_versions(job_id: str | None = None, limit: int | None = None) -> ListResumeVersionsResult`

Lists saved resume versions **newest first**, as summaries — no `content` field, so listing 20
versions doesn't dump 20 full resumes into context. Call `get_resume_version` once you know
which id you want. Filter to versions tailored for one job with `job_id` (the id
`save_job_analysis` returned for that job).

### `set_work_authorization(countries: list[str]) -> SetWorkAuthorizationResult`

Declares the **full** list of countries you may legally work in — **replaces** any prior
declaration, it does not add to it. Pass an empty list to explicitly declare you're authorized
nowhere (distinct from never having called this tool at all — `analyze_job` treats the two
differently). Country names are free text; the server canonicalizes common spellings (`"USA"`,
`"United States"`, `"U.S."` all match) but never rejects an unrecognized one — it echoes back
both the raw text you gave and the canonical form it stored, so a misread is visible
immediately rather than causing a silent false warning later.

## Tool vs. reasoning boundary

These tools only **persist and shape data**. Claude handles all reasoning:
- Scoring the match between the resume and the pasted posting
- Interpreting the work-authorization warning in context
- Whether the role is a good fit overall

This is intentional — tools that encode judgment make Claude less useful, not more.

## Releasing

Publishing is driven by a tag. Bump the version in **both** `pyproject.toml` and
`manifest.json`, merge that to `master`, then:

```bash
git tag v0.3.0
git push origin v0.3.0
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` takes it from there: it checks that the tag,
`pyproject.toml` and `manifest.json` all name the same version, runs lint and the
full test suite on Python 3.11/3.12/3.13, builds the sdist and wheel, runs
`twine check`, and only then uploads.

Everything that can fail runs *before* the upload on purpose — PyPI never lets a
version number be reused, even after a delete, so a bad publish cannot be undone,
only superseded.

**One-time setup.** The workflow authenticates with [PyPI Trusted
Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) rather than an API token,
so there is no long-lived secret in the repo to leak or rotate. GitHub signs a
short-lived token per run and PyPI verifies the signature.

`runway-mcp` already exists on PyPI, so this is a publisher on an existing
project — not a *pending* publisher, which is the separate flow for a name that
has never been published. Go to
<https://pypi.org/manage/project/runway-mcp/settings/publishing/>, choose
**GitHub** under *Add a new publisher*, and fill in exactly:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owner | `satovarb16` |
| Repository name | `runwayMCP` |
| Workflow name | `release.yml` |
| Environment name | `pypi` |

All four must match or PyPI rejects the token — the environment name in
particular, since it is what scopes the trust to the gated job rather than to
any workflow in the repo.

On the GitHub side, the `pypi` environment is created automatically the first
time the workflow runs. Create it yourself under *Settings → Environments* if you
want to add required reviewers first, which gates the upload behind a manual
approval — worth doing, given that a published version can never be reused.
