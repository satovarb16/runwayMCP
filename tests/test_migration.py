"""Migration tests (design D4, spec R19-R23, SC-40..SC-48).

Tested end-to-end with realistic JSON fixtures written to disk, not mocks —
this is the part that touches real user data. The riskiest single test in
this release is test_orphan_job_url_migrates_to_legacy_job_url_not_general,
which proves a resume version whose job_url matches no saved job does NOT
get silently promoted to the "general" resume (the scoring baseline for
every future job) by the migration itself.
