"""Tests for tools/_db.py — connection, PRAGMAs, schema DDL (design D1-D3).

These tests exist specifically to prove the four PRAGMAs the design calls
out as "fail silently if you get them wrong": foreign_keys, recursive_triggers,
busy_timeout, and BEGIN IMMEDIATE (vs DEFERRED). Each has its own test rather
than being asserted as a group, because each is an independent one-line
omission that silently removes a guarantee.
